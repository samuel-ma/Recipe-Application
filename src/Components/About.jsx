      Long-term dried and aged meat is fragrant and crispy and does not let the meat juice escape
      </h3>
      <p>
      Wolfgang's Steakhouse was founded in Manhattan in 2004 by Wolfgang's Steakhouse, who has been active in NY's prestigious steakhouse for over 40 years. The deliciousness of the special steak made it a thriving restaurant in a blink of an eye. Nowadays, it is extremely popular in New York, Waikiki, Miami, and Beverly Hills as a "best steakhouse" that makes even the most discerning gourmans groan. The second domestic store is the Marunouchi store. There are 4 private rooms, each with its own entrance, so it can be widely used for private parties and entertainment.
